## Welcome

This site is a compilation of my personal projects I have worked on to further my knowledge in areas that interested me. Some are successes and some are complete failures, but all of them played a part in shaping my current understanding of various programming languages, frameworks, tools, and methodologies.  All coding projects are also available on my [Github](https://github.com/vengaza). Thanks for visiting!
