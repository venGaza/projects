## Thanks for visiting!

Sometimes you don’t know what you want until you just do. I had no clue what career I wanted to pursue after finishing college, but I did know that I wanted to live a life of adventure! After a slight life detour through military healthcare, I decided to completely change paths and delve into the world of programming.

With exabytes of data being produced daily, machine learning (ML) has come to be the forefront solution to find the most valuable signals within all the noise. I’m interested in driving this movement forward by helping to build and deploy ML solutions within industries such as security, medicine, and autonomous vehicles. Even though ML cannot solve every problem, there are still plenty of use cases and data yet to be discovered. Sounds like a modern day treasure hunt to me and a thrilling adventure.
